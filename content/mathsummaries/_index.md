title: "Math Topics"

A collection of mathematical leverage maps covering core domains of modern mathematics, each designed to provide orientation, key concepts, signature theorems, and connections to other fields.

These came about when I was wanting to get ammunition for intuition. This is further ammunition Katiya's intuition for the structure of maths.

They will read a little odd as they came from discussions with Claude where we were messing about trying to get at mental structures to understand a wide variety of math fields. They're for future reference as a pure outline NOT intended as any form of rigorous treatment, homework help or anything like that. However, if they prove vaguely useful or interesting to you, do say hi.
