# Quantum Holographic Error Correction in Brains

```
Me finkz quantum neural compute jus needs Poincare fractal hierarchical geometry error correction coz dat is the arch of da memory graph of neurology n e way imho. So if dat b true, den I reckon quantum effects in cognition IZ gonna be JUS fine c...lots room for correctinz! haha Claude need teasing. Also checkit - Orchestrated Reduction or summat by Hameroff and Penrose was a fing 2 but dem didn't get enough physical evidence yet. Deez folkz will be mostly rite but dem miss error correctinz n fractal poincare tensor geometry. Wot u fink? Iz nutz? :P

One day, soon, the pidgin will be explained. At that point, the GUT will have been discovered, the Riemann Hypothesis solved, and warp drives made to work (they're just folding space, after all—I'll fly unaided). Until that day, let's play with the ideas from Katiya's elegant, eloquent, and erudite-sounding English.

We hear constantly that quantum effects in the brain are vulnerable to messiness—too warm, too wet. But what happens if there is plenty of error correction to go round?

Have you ever come across hyperbolic geometry or Poincaré discs? In these geometries, the space trends toward infinite area or volume the nearer you get to the edge. The same is true of the Poincaré ball.

**Kat's Hypothesis:** Human memory is best mapped onto the equivalent of a hierarchy of higher-dimensional Poincaré balls. Think of it like a higher-rank tensor, which is just a nesting of lower-rank tensors, but constructed using this hyperbolic geometry rather than flat numbers. The result? Plenty of space.

She couples this with perhaps the loosest-sounding definition of "standing wave harmonic memory location" anyone is ever likely to come across—yet it apparently solves the massive problem of searching for specific memories in a near-infinite search space.

But that's a subject for another day. The core speculation here is that the connectome—the memory graph itself—IS best mapped using hyperbolic geometry. Katiya suggests a form of Poincaré fractal geometry would allow this to work by generating a form of topological protection.

In essence, she is attempting to conceptually synthesize Holographic Quantum Error Correction (AdS/CFT correspondence) with neuroscience.

This thought train was triggered by the linked article discussing the zero-point field and the brain. As ever, this is a speculation piece, kept for posterity. I want to look back in the future and see if any of these ideas panned out.
