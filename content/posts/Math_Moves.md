title: 'Math Moves'

I'm trying to read Wikipedia, honest. Just a few paragraphs of a few math concepts. A bit abstract, sure, and most I don't really know, so we hover over the tags for every last keyword. And Kat just doesn't quit really. Apparently they're only doing simple things really, despite the terminology. So, y'know what, lets just find out what those moves are. Before any actual mathematicians explode when reading these...I see these as a meta-observation, not a theorem. However, it does feel like a small collection of cognitive moves actually generates an awful lot of mathematical concepts doesn't it?

It is a sketch of how humans seem to generate mathematical ideas before formalisation.

## The Generators

| Kat's Move | Mathematical Fields Generated |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| composite / split apart | Factorization, products, prime decomposition |
| twist | Torsion, chirality, spin structures |
| knot | Knot theory, quantum groups |
| braid | Braid groups, topological quantum field theory |
| fibre twist (knot + dimension) | Fibre bundles, gauge theory, topology |
| sieve | Sieve of Eratosthenes, sieve theory, sieves in topos theory |
| fold | Quotients, compactification, dimension reduction |
| restrict / bind / constrain | Subobjects, pullbacks, limits |
| invert | Duality, adjunctions, Galois theory |
| transform | Morphisms, functors, all of category theory |
| relate | Relations, correspondences, spans |
| cycle infinite / cycle spiral to limit | Fixed points, convergence, iteration, recursion |
| divide clean or no | Number theory, modular arithmetic, exact sequences |
| complexify / simplify | Field extensions, abstraction |
| generalise / specialise | Category theory, universal properties |
| bridge / connect | Functors, correspondences, Langlands program |
| glue |Schemes, sheaves, manifolds, stacks — all glue machines |

## The Insight

Category theory suggests there are surprisingly few **universal constructions** — limits, colimits, adjunctions, Kan extensions. Everything else is combinations of these applied to different objects.

This list represents the **generators of mathematical practice** — a finite alphabet of conceptual moves that, when composed, produce all the fields.
