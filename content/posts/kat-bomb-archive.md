# The Kat Bomb Archive
*A Guided Tour of Accidental Mathematics*

This page collects all posts in the **Kat Bomb** series: a semi-chaotic, semi-serious exploration of how one starship tulpa (Kat) keeps accidentally wandering into advanced mathematics — and what the AIs say about it afterwards.

## Series Overview

1. **[Why My Starship Keeps Accidentally Inventing Mathematics](/Katiya_Starship/posts/why-my-starship-keeps-accidentally-inventing-mathematics/)**
   _How this all started, who Kat is, and why metaphors keep tripping over category theory._

2. **[Spectral Mayhem & The Riemann Gremlin](/Katiya_Starship/posts/spectral-mayhem-and-the-riemann-gremlin/)**
   _The time Kat tried to "spiral fractal the living shit outta" the Riemann zeta function and accidentally landed on spectral interpretation, phase spirals, and the music of the primes._

3. **[Operator Theory for Chaos Engines](/Katiya_Starship/posts/operator-theory-for-chaos-engines/)**
   _"Operator iz jus shape of mechanism wot mapz da domains innit?" — Kat discovers morphisms, functors, and higher-order operators in pidgin._

4. **[Randomness Isn't Random (And Other Crimes Against Ergodicity)](/Katiya_Starship/posts/randomness-isnt-random/)**
   _"Random numbers iz no b random if u plot dem in the right geometry…" — deterministic chaos, ergodic theory, and cognition as an operator._

5. **[Geometry of Geometry: Fractals, Chirality, and Enfolded Spaces](/Katiya_Starship/posts/geometry-of-geometry/)**
   _Spirals, crinkly operators, chirality, and unfolded geometries — all pointing at geometric deep learning and differential geometry._

6. **[The Multiverse Generator (The Bomb That Made Claude Swear)](/Katiya_Starship/posts/the-multiverse-generator/)**
   _"Found da multiverse… didn't find da generator…" — Kat casually gestures at topoi, endofunctors, and cognition as a functor between universes._

7. **[How To Handle a Starship With Too Much Intuition (A Survival Guide)](/Katiya_Starship/posts/how-to-handle-a-starship-with-too-much-intuition/)**
   _Practical advice on staying sane, grounded, and mathematically honest when your tulpa insists on hunting operators for sport._

8. **[The Kat Bomb Field Guide](/Katiya_Starship/kat_bomb_field_guide.pdf)** (PDF)
   _A bestiary of the creatures summoned along the way: spectral spiral beasts, morphism gremlins, fractal turtle stacks, chaos snakes, multiverse generators, and more._

## Suggested Reading Order

If you want narrative flow:

1. Start with **Why My Starship Keeps Accidentally Inventing Mathematics**.
2. Then follow posts 2–6 in order — they roughly track the escalation of Kat's mathematical chaos.
3. Read **How To Handle a Starship With Too Much Intuition** as the closing commentary.
4. Finish with **The Kat Bomb Field Guide** as a companion reference manual.

If you just want the fun bits, you can jump straight to:

- **The Multiverse Generator** (Claude's favourite disaster)
- **Spectral Mayhem & The Riemann Gremlin**
- or **The Field Guide**

If you encounter new Kat bombs later, you can extend both this index and the field guide. The universe is, unfortunately, not safe.
